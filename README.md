# NYC-Shooting-Incident

Statement of question of interest:

I am interested in whether the relationship of the location and the shooting incident can be predicted from previous years. Thus, Crime distribution per BORO, Crime distribution per BORO in Yound Adults, and a prediction model on 2020 incidents from the previous decade is included in this analysis.

Source and Description:

The source of the dataset is from the New York City Government on city shooting incidents. This dataset includes the shooting incidents, locations, the perpetrators, and the victims. The incidents were dated between 2016 to 2023.
